# Lab 9: Introduction to Python Programming with Input and Output

## Objective

This lab introduces fundamental Python programming concepts, focusing on **standard input and output operations**. Students will learn how to collect input from users, perform simple computations or logic, and display results.

## Files Included

* `Task-1.py` – A basic Python script demonstrating input, variable handling, and output.
* `Task-2.py` – An enhancement with conditional logic or control flow structures.

## Purpose of the Lab

* Practice writing simple Python programs.
* Understand the syntax and structure of basic Python scripts.
* Gain confidence using `input()` and `print()` functions.
* Apply basic conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

## Technologies Used

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Tools**: Any Python IDE or code editor (VS Code, IDLE, PyCharm, etc.)
* **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the `Lab-9` directory.
4. Run the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
python Task-1.py
```

```bash
python Task-2.py
```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts.

## Learning Outcomes

* Handle user input and output in Python.
* Store and manipulate data using variables.
* Make decisions in code using conditional statements.

## Applications

* Building interactive command-line utilities.
* Foundation for automation scripts.
* Stepping stone to more advanced Python programming concepts.
