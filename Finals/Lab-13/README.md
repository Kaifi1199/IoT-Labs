# Lab 13: Environmental Data Classification Using DHT Sensor and Machine Learning

## Objective

This lab demonstrates a complete **end-to-end IoT + Machine Learning pipeline**. Environmental data collected from a DHT sensor is classified using a trained ML model, with deployment support for microcontroller integration and cloud logging (InfluxDB).

## Files Included

### üìÅ Machine Learning (Python)

* `0-train_model.py` ‚Äì Trains a base ML model on clean DHT data.
* `1-dht_data_only.py` ‚Äì Captures real-time DHT sensor data.
* `2-train_model_with_noise.py` ‚Äì Trains the model on noisy DHT data to improve generalization.
* `3-classify_2_influx_.py` ‚Äì Classifies DHT data and sends labeled output to InfluxDB.
* `dht_classifier.h5` ‚Äì Trained Keras model (saved format).
* `normalization.npz` ‚Äì Preprocessing parameters (mean/std) used for input normalization.

### üìÅ Microcontroller Code

* `esp_2_mos_simple/esp_2_mos_simple.ino` ‚Äì Arduino sketch to interface ESP device with Mosquitto MQTT broker.

## Purpose of the Lab

* Build and train an ML model to classify environmental conditions using DHT sensor data.
* Simulate real-world deployment by integrating ESP and MQTT with ML inference output.
* Log classified results to a cloud database (InfluxDB) for visualization and analysis.
